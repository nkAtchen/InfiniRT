"""Compare every allocation strategy across the CPU and device backends.

The question this answers is three questions, and they need different builds to
answer honestly:

  direct vs arena      Is the arena worth having at all on this backend?
  pool vs arena        Which pool design wins, and on which shapes?
  arena vs cuda_async  Does a hand-written arena beat the vendor's own pool?

The third only exists on a device, and the first has a completely different
answer on each backend -- a host `malloc` costs tens of nanoseconds, so nothing
the arena saves can pay for its bookkeeping, while a `cudaMalloc` costs hundreds
of microseconds and the same arena wins by orders of magnitude. Reporting one
number for "the allocator" would average those into something true of neither.
So this configures and runs both builds and prints each comparison per backend.

Usage:

    python scripts/compare_allocators.py                 # build, run, compare
    python scripts/compare_allocators.py --quick         # shorter arms
    python scripts/compare_allocators.py --no-build      # reuse what is built
    python scripts/compare_allocators.py --backend cpu   # one backend only

A note on why the builds are serialized rather than parallel: `generated/` is
written into the *source* tree at configure time and its contents depend on which
backends are enabled, so two configured build trees cannot be compiled
concurrently -- the second would compile against the first's headers. Each
backend is therefore configured, built, and only then is anything run.
